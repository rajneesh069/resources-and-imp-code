# Insights from Mentorship Call with Adrian W.

For those who don't know him, Adrian W. has been a web developer for the past 10 years. I got picked up for mentorship randomly through his mentorship post on Twitter. Here are the insights from our call:

## JavaScript Section:

1. **What is an event loop?**
   - He taught me about the call stack, callback queue, and how the asynchronous nature of JavaScript works. He also recommended a YouTube video regarding it. [Watch Video](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)

2. **How is event loop related to promises?**
   - After event loop, we talked about promises. He taught me about the syntax and how they manage asynchronous operations. I also learned more about `setTimeout()`.

3. **How is async-await related to promises?**
   - I learned that async-await is a syntactical sugar that works on top of promises. Both of them work similarly, but async-await provides more readability and easier understanding of the code.

4. **What are some good coding habits?**
   - He emphasized using precise and accurate variable and function names for better code readability. He also talked about the importance of code readability.

5. **What is the weightage of DSA in interviews?**
   - He mentioned that while he didn't have to implement complex data structures and algorithms like quick sort in interviews, DSA knowledge is still important, especially for companies in India.

6. **How has your approach to solving coding problems changed over the years?**
   - Breaking down larger problems into smaller ones and solving them incrementally has been helpful. He recommended the book "Clean Code" for writing good code.

## Job Hunting:

1. **Which portals did you use for job applications?**
   - He mentioned Indeed and [Dice](https://dice.com) as two portals he used.

2. **What else should I focus on besides coding skills?**
   - Having a positive attitude and confidence in your abilities are crucial. He emphasized being proactive and self-reliant.

3. **How do I network with people in tech?**
   - Networking didn't matter much in his experience. He suggested starting with networking in college and within the company once you're hired.

4. **What interview tips do you have?**
   - He recommended the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" and emphasized being yourself, staying positive, and showcasing your problem-solving skills.

5. **Additional Insights:**
   - Don't try too hard to impress the interviewer; they're already interested in you.
   - Accept that nervousness is part of the process.
   - Show a positive attitude and conviction in your abilities.
   - Think of yourself as a solution to the company's problems.

These insights and tips are valuable for anyone in the field of web development and job hunting.
